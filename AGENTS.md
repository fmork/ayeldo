# ü§ñ AGENTS.md

This file provides **project-specific guidance** for AI coding agents (e.g., Codex, Copilot, ChatGPT).  
Its purpose is to keep all generated code consistent with the agreed **architecture, style, and conventions**.

---

## üìö Reference Materials

Agents should always consult these documents before scaffolding or modifying code:

- `docs/architecture.c4.dsl` ‚Üí C4 model (system context, containers, flows)
- `docs/todo.md` ‚Üí Implementation roadmap (checklist)
- `docs/dynamo.md` ‚Üí DynamoDB single-table design
- `docs/events.md` ‚Üí Event definitions and schemas
- `docs/security.md` ‚Üí Security practices

## üìù Coding Guidelines (TypeScript)

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Strict mode (`"strict": true`) in `tsconfig`.
- Don't use TypeScript enums.
- Don't export imported variables.
- Always add type annotations to variables, parameters, and class properties unless they are initialized with literal expressions.
- Always add type annotations to function return types.
- Don't use TypeScript namespaces.
- Don't use non-null assertions with the `!` postfix operator.
- Don't use parameter properties in class constructors.
- Don't use user-defined types.
- Use `as const` instead of literal types and type annotations.
- Use either `Array<T>` consistently for array declarations.
- Initialize each enum member value explicitly.
- Use `export type` for types.
- Use `import type` for types.
- Make sure all enum members are literal values.
- Don't use TypeScript const enum.
- Don't declare empty interfaces.
- Don't let variables evolve into any type through reassignments.
- Don't use the any type.
- Don't misuse the non-null assertion operator (!) in TypeScript files.
- Don't use implicit any type on variable declarations.
- Don't merge interfaces and classes unsafely.
- Don't use overload signatures that aren't next to each other.
- Use the namespace keyword instead of the module keyword to declare TypeScript namespaces.
- Prefer **readonly** properties, arrays, and parameters.
- Always use `async/await` for async code (no `.then()` chaining).
- Runtime validation with **zod** on all external input (API, events, env).
- File naming conventions:
  - Files: `camelCase`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Directories: `kebab-case`

## üèó Architecture Rules

- **BFF pattern**

  - Browser never sees OIDC tokens.
  - BFF performs token exchange and issues HttpOnly session cookies.
  - BFF calls Domain API using internal auth (signed JWT or API key).

- **Layered separation**

  - **Domain (`core`)** is **pure** (no AWS imports).
  - **Ports** define contracts for repos, services, publishers.
  - **Infra (`infra-aws`)** implements ports with AWS SDK.
  - **Apps (`bff`, `api`, `services`)** provide Lambda entrypoints, wire DI, delegate to domain.

- **Event-driven**
  - All significant state changes emit events (EventBridge).
  - Consumers must be **idempotent**.
  - Services should not call each other directly across bounded contexts.

---

## üóÑ Data & Infrastructure Principles

- **DynamoDB single-table** design

  - Typed prefixes for keys (e.g., `TENANT#id`, `ALBUM#id`, `ORDER#id`).
  - Secondary indexes for album tree, images by album, orders by user.
  - TTL on carts and sessions.

- **EventBridge**

  - Domain events (`UserCreated`, `ImageUploaded`, `OrderPaid`, ‚Ä¶).
  - Each event includes `id`, `type`, `occurredAt`, `tenantId`, and `payload`.

- **S3 & CloudFront**

  - S3 for asset storage (originals, derivatives).
  - Short-lived signed URLs for downloads.

- **IAM**
  - Enforce least privilege: Lambdas only access their table keys and bucket prefixes.

---

## üé® Style & Structure

- **Dependency Injection** with `tsyringe`.

  - Per-invocation container.
  - Heavy clients (DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge) cached in module scope.

- **Handler philosophy**

  - BFF and API handlers should be **thin**.
  - Validate input with `zod`.
  - Delegate to domain services via ports.

- **Service responsibilities**
  - **BFF**: auth/session management, orchestration, aggregation.
  - **API**: domain orchestration, event emission.
  - **Services**: vertical concerns (images, pricing, orders, analytics).

---

## üß™ Testing Rules

- **Vitest** for unit tests.
- All domain logic (pricing, order state machine, policies) must have tests.
- **LocalStack** for integration tests of repos and S3 flows.
- Contract tests for events (validate against schemas).

---

## üîê Security Practices

- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies for sessions.
- CSRF protection (header token or double-submit cookie).
- Input validation with zod for all external input.
- Rotate secrets (BFF JWT signing key) via SSM Parameter Store.
- Signed CloudFront/S3 URLs with short TTL for downloads.

---

## üìñ Documentation Discipline

- Update `docs/todo.md` when adding or completing features.
- Update `docs/architecture.c4.dsl` when changing system structure.
- Render/export diagrams for visibility when making major changes.
- Keep this `AGENTS.md` aligned with real-world decisions.

## ‚úÖ Agent Workflow

When Codex (or another AI agent) generates code, it should:

1. **Check references** (`C4 DSL`, `todo.md`, `dynamo.md`, `events.md`).
2. **Follow coding rules** (strict TS, zod validation, async/await, no any).
3. **Respect architecture** (BFF ‚Üí API ‚Üí Services, ports, events).
4. **Produce tests** for new domain logic.
5. **Document** new features in `docs/` as needed.
